# WIP Minimal League of Legends client

Currently supports picking and banning champions in champion select, and printing all
champions picked and banned to stdout

## Acknowledgements

Some of the code for websockets and finding the league process is based on the code of 
[Shaco](https://github.com/Leastrio/Shaco), so special thanks to the maintainers of that
project.
